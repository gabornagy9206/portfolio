      <h3 class="text-secondary">BIO</h3>
      <p>I attended Liska József highschool at Jászberény, and after graduation I stood for another 2 years, to learn
        to become an automation technician. After that, I went to study electrical engineering at BME. I've studied here
        for 5 years, made it through 70% of it, but then I decided I'd rather not finish class, and chase my dream of
        becoming a Web Developer. I started taking courses from Udemy in JavaScript development and Angular 2+. Being a
        self learning developer is hard, but I was up for the challenge!

      <p>From the age of 10 I have been playing basketball in my hometown of Jászberény. Played through all the development
